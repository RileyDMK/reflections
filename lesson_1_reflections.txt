How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It is much easier to find bugs when you know exactly where to look.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Easier to fix bugs. Easier to try things out that may break the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You can make commits at logical intervals so that versions actually make sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some files are interrelated so it makes sense to save them all at once in git. Google Docs only deals in single files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see the commit history and git diff to compare the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back and find the bug or revert to a working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control of upcoming projects.
